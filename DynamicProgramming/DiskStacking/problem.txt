  You're given a non-empty array of arrays where each subarray holds three
  integers and represents a disk. These integers denote each disk's width,
  depth, and height, respectively. Your goal is to stack up the disks and to
  maximize the total height of the stack. A disk must have a strictly smaller
  width, depth, and height than any other disk below it.

  Write a function that returns an array of the disks in the final stack,
  starting with the top disk and ending with the bottom disk. Note that you
  can't rotate disks; in other words, the integers in each subarray must
  represent [width, depth, height] at all times.
