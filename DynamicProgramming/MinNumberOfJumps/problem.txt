  You're given a non-empty array of positive integers where each integer represents the
  maximum number of steps you can take forward in the array. For example, if the
  element at index 1 is 3, you can go from index 1 to index 2, 3 and 4.


  Write a function that returns the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the
  final index.
