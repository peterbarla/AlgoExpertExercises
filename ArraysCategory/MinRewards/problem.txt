Given an array of distinct positive integers, allocate for each element in the array a number starting from 1 in a way that each allocated number 
for an element must be bigger than the allocated number for the adjenct element if that is bigger, and smaller numbers than the allocated number
for the adjenct element if that is smaller than the current element.Allocate numbers for each element so that the sum will be the smallest possible.
