  You're looking to move into a new apartment, and you're given a list of blocks
  where each block contains an apartment that you could move into. In order to
  pick your apartment, you want to optimize its location. You also have a list
  of requirements: a list of buildings that are important to you. For instance,
  you might value having a school and a gym near your apartment. The list of
  blocks that you have contains information at every block about all of the
  buildings that are present and absent at the block in question. For instance,
  for every block, you might know whether a school, a pool, an office, and a gym
  are present.
